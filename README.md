# COSC499_Assignment1
Around the world, professional number guessers roam. You happen to be one of them... Or do you? 

You are walking down the street one sunny day until you are approached by a snarky (and perhaps a little unpleasant to be around) person. They decide to put you to the test to see if you truly are a MASTER number guesser. Can you guess their number in 1 guess? 

==========

Features: 

1. Read the introduction carefully and then begin playing. Input a number between 1-10 (the person will make some rude comments if you don't follow instructions!), depending on how many guesses you've made you will get a snarky comment. Or perhaps if you guess the number correctly on your first try, you'll get a pleasant comment. Wow! 

2. You will be able to see the results of how you did, and how many guesses it took you. Be warned though, this heckler is not the nicest person in the world! 

Thanks for playing!
